# Inefficient innerHTML Manipulation in HTML
This repository demonstrates a common, yet inefficient approach to modifying the innerHTML of an HTML element. The bug showcases repeated access to innerHTML, which can lead to performance issues.  A solution is also provided that uses more efficient DOM manipulation techniques.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in repeatedly accessing the `innerHTML` property to append content. This creates unnecessary overhead, especially for large or complex HTML structures. 

## Bug Solution
The solution improves efficiency by directly manipulating the DOM using `appendChild()` instead of repeatedly accessing and reassigning `innerHTML`. This approach results in better performance, particularly for large HTML fragments.
